# UNEP-link-localizer

Goal: Find the translated webpage of an UN website. Do it in batch on a document or folder level.

Input: https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/climate-crisis-alters-their-lands-indigenous-peoples-turn-courts
Output: https://www.unep.org/es/noticias-y-reportajes/reportajes/los-pueblos-indigenas-recurren-los-tribunales-ante-la-crisis

It does it for all hyperlinks inside a:
* Word document,
* a PDF, or
* an UNEP web article.

So far it can localize links from websites of United Nations agencies like:
* UNEP
* UNDP
* UN HQ - topics and International Days
* WHO
* PAHO
* UN WOMEN
* There is general function to process web domains that have not been tailored.

Websites that need to be tailored:
* UNFCC
* WHO news (double language switcher)
* UN HQ news (no common node shared between languages, Google search engine approach filtered by site:un.org/LANGUAGE_CODE/YEAR/MONTH)
